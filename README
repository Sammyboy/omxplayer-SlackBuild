OMXPlayer -- Raspberry Pi command line OMX player

OMXPlayer was developed as a testbed for the XBMC Raspberry PI implementation and is quite handy to use standalone.
It's a video player which supports hardware acceleration on the Raspberry PI.

You'll need to have the RPi firmware files installed in /opt/vc. If that folder doesn't exist, download the firmware files form https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware and copy them to /opt/vc.
