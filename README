OMXPlayer -- Raspberry Pi command line OMX player

OMXPlayer was developed as a testbed for the XBMC Raspberry PI implementation and is quite handy to use standalone.
It's a video player which supports hardware acceleration on the Raspberry PI.

You'll need to have the RPi firmware files installed in /opt/vc. If that folder doesn't exist, download the firmware files form https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware and copy them to /opt/vc.

Also, /dev/vchiq must be read and writable for all users. If it's not, run
  
  chmod a+rw /dev/vchiq
  
as root and add that command line to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local.


If you wish to keep the cloned git folder for reuse next time, use 

  KEEP_GIT=1 ./omxplayer

Once the KEEP_GIT option is set to 1, next time(s) the folder will be refreshed instead of new cloning.
Next time you don't need to set the KEEP_GIT option if you don't want to reset it (the script will set it automatically if the git folder exists).
To reset that setting, use 

  KEEP_GIT=0 ./omxplayer

and the cloned git folder will be removed after creating the archive file. This also is the standard behaviour if KEEP_GIT was not set to 1.


rubygem-ronn is an optional dependency, useful if the website http://mantastic.herokuapp.com/ is not available on build time and the build script fails to create the file "omxplayer.1". Installing rubygem-ronn is the safe way and recommended.
