OMXPlayer -- Raspberry Pi command line OMX player

OMXPlayer was developed as a testbed for the XBMC Raspberry PI implementation and is quite handy to use standalone.
It's a video player which supports hardware acceleration on the Raspberry PI.

You'll need to have the RPi firmware files installed in /opt/vc. If that folder doesn't exist, download the firmware files form https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware and copy them to /opt/vc.

Also, /dev/vchiq must be read and writable for all users. If it's not, run
  
  chmod a+rw /dev/vchiq
  
as root and add that command line to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local.


If you wish to keep the cloned git folder for reuse next time, use 

  KEEP_GIT=1 ./omxplayer.SlackBuild

Once the KEEP_GIT option is set to 1, next time(s) the folder will be refreshed instead of new cloning.
Next time you don't need to set the KEEP_GIT option if you don't want to reset it (the script will set it automatically if the git folder exists).
To reset that setting, use 

  KEEP_GIT=0 ./omxplayer.SlackBuild

and the cloned git folder will be removed after creating the archive file. This also is the standard behaviour if KEEP_GIT was not set to 1.


rubygem-ronn is an optional dependency, useful if the website http://mantastic.herokuapp.com/ is not available on build time and the build script fails to create the man page file "omxplayer.1". Installing rubygem-ronn is the safe way and recommended.


The option
  SOFT_FLOAT=yes    or    SOFT_FLOAT=no
can be set, otherwise it tries to automatically detect the right one.

Further options are
  CROSS_COMPILE=yes
to enable cross compiling
and
  WITH_FFMPEG=yes   or   WITH_FFMPEG=no
to force or avoid building ffmpeg. If this option is not set, it builds ffmpeg if it's not installed and otherwise skips building it.

So for example, building the package on SlackwareARM-current in soft float mode and with ffmpeg, use
  SOFT_FLOAT=yes WITH_FFMPEG=yes ./omxplayer.SlackBuild

Without these two options the script autodetects ffmpeg and soft float mode.
